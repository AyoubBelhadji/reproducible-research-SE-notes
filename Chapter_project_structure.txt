# Setting up a Software Project

## Understand the Project Structure

Let's imagine you are taking care of a friend's cat that moved in town a couple of weeks ago.
Your friend lend you his keys and instructs you to just go to the kitchen and fill the bowls with some food and water.
He tells you also that he left all doors closed so the cat does not go around all over the place.
Furthermore, you were never invited to your friend's place before, this will be the first time you will see it.

GUILLE: HERE.

The structure we use to organise a software project is key to understand and navigate it.
